# Get-CPEVStatus

## Get-CPEVStatus (Chromium Password Extraction Vulnerability)

This script is a vulnerability assessment tool for Chromium-based browsers. It identifies potentially extractable passwords stored within browser profiles, indicating their susceptibility to exploitation. The script itself does not store user credentials but provides a clear assessment of which browser profiles contain extractable passwords and the total number found. Testing reveals that while the script is detected by Sophos antivirus, it does not effectively prevent the harvesting of sensitive credentials.
